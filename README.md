# ClassObjectsPie
A demonstration of creating objects with random generation based on user set parameters. Pie charts that are randomly generated.

This project simulates animated pie charts that grow incrementally over time. Each pie chart has a title and a random color, and the animation is interactive: the pie's position can be adjusted by dragging with the mouse when hovered over.

Features
Animated Pie Charts: Each pie chart gradually increases its filled angle.
Interactivity: Pie charts can be dragged by the user when the mouse is pressed and hovered near them.
Randomized Appearance: The pies have random sizes, colors, and initial positions.
Multiple Pie Charts: Five pie charts are displayed, each with a unique title and different growing speed.
